# Token Tracking Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to the token tracking system to align with official Gemini API documentation and resolve issues found in logs and the `/token-usage` endpoint.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Incorrect Pricing
**Problem**: The token tracker was using outdated pricing that didn't match the official Gemini API documentation.

**Before Fix**:
- Input: $0.000075 per 1M tokens (incorrect)
- Output: $0.0003 per 1M tokens (incorrect)
- Cached: $0.000025 per 1M tokens (incorrect)

**After Fix** (Official Gemini 2.5 Flash pricing):
- Input: $0.15 per 1M tokens (text/image/video)
- Output: $0.60 per 1M tokens (non-thinking)
- Output: $3.50 per 1M tokens (thinking)
- Cached: $0.0375 per 1M tokens (text/image/video)
- Thoughts: $0.15 per 1M tokens

### 2. Missing Thinking Model Support
**Problem**: The system didn't properly handle thinking models (Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro) which have different pricing for output tokens when thoughts are generated.

**Fix**: Added proper detection and pricing for thinking models:
- Added `is_thinking` parameter to cost calculations
- Implemented thinking model detection based on thoughts tokens
- Added separate pricing for thinking vs non-thinking output

### 3. Token Counting Errors
**Problem**: Logs showed 0 output tokens in many cases, indicating the token counting wasn't working properly for failed responses.

**Root Cause**: When Gemini API responses had finish_reason 2 (safety blocking), the `response.text` was not available, but the system still tried to access it.

**Fix**: Enhanced error handling:
- Added validation for response.text availability before access
- Improved error logging with response object details
- Added fallback handling for invalid responses

### 4. Missing Debugging Information
**Problem**: Limited visibility into token tracking issues.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive debugging:
- Enhanced token usage logging with detailed breakdowns
- Added response object type and attribute checking
- Improved error messages with context

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/token_tracker.py`
**Changes**:
- Updated pricing to match official Gemini API documentation
- Added support for thinking model pricing (`output_thinking`)
- Enhanced `calculate_cost()` method with `is_thinking` parameter
- Updated `log_token_usage()` to handle thinking models
- Added debugging information for token usage details
- Enhanced session tracking with thinking model information

**Key Updates**:
```python
# Updated pricing structure
self.pricing = {
    "gemini-2.5-flash": {
        "input": 0.15,      # $0.15 per 1M input tokens
        "output": 0.60,     # $0.60 per 1M output tokens (non-thinking)
        "output_thinking": 3.50,  # $3.50 per 1M output tokens (thinking)
        "cached": 0.0375,   # $0.0375 per 1M cached tokens
        "thoughts": 0.15    # Same as input for thinking models
    }
}

# Enhanced cost calculation
def calculate_cost(self, usage: TokenUsage, is_thinking: bool = False):
    if is_thinking and usage.thoughts_tokens > 0:
        output_cost = (usage.output_tokens / 1_000_000) * pricing["output_thinking"]
    else:
        output_cost = (usage.output_tokens / 1_000_000) * pricing["output"]
```

### 2. `src/gemini_client.py`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced `_track_token_usage()` method with thinking model detection
- Added response validation before accessing `response.text`
- Improved error handling for invalid responses
- Added debugging information for token tracking issues

**Key Updates**:
```python
def _track_token_usage(self, response, operation: str = "API Call"):
    # Check if this is a thinking model response
    is_thinking = self.token_tracker.is_thinking_model() and thoughts_tokens > 0
    
    # Enhanced error handling
    if not hasattr(response, 'text') or not response.text:
        logger.error("Invalid response: No text content available")
        return
```

## Testing Results

### Test Script: `test_token_tracking_fix.py`
**Results**:
- âœ… Pricing matches official Gemini API documentation
- âœ… Cost calculations work correctly for all scenarios
- âœ… Session tracking functions properly
- âœ… Thinking model detection works
- âœ… Realistic scenario testing shows accurate costs

**Sample Output**:
```
ðŸ“Š Realistic usage from logs:
  Input tokens: 18,113
  Output tokens: 856
  Cached tokens: 17,398
  Thoughts tokens: 0

ðŸ’° Cost breakdown:
  Input cost: $0.002717
  Output cost: $0.000514
  Cached cost: $0.000652
  Total cost: $0.003883

ðŸ“ˆ Projected total cost for 27 batches: $0.104840
```

## Impact on Cost Calculations

### Before Fix
- Incorrect pricing led to significantly underestimated costs
- No support for thinking model pricing
- Inaccurate session summaries

### After Fix
- **Accurate pricing** based on official Gemini API documentation
- **Proper thinking model support** with correct pricing
- **Realistic cost projections** for full processing

### Cost Comparison Example
Using realistic token counts from logs:
- **Before**: ~$0.000001 per batch (incorrect)
- **After**: ~$0.003883 per batch (accurate)
- **Total for 27 batches**: ~$0.104840 (about 10.5 cents)

## API Endpoints

### `/token-usage`
- Returns accurate token usage summary
- Includes thinking model information
- Provides detailed cost breakdown

### `/reset-token-tracking`
- Resets session tracking for new processing runs
- Maintains historical data in logs

## Verification

### 1. Pricing Verification
- âœ… Matches official Gemini API documentation
- âœ… Supports all model variants (2.5 Flash/Pro, 1.5 Flash/Pro)
- âœ… Correct thinking model pricing

### 2. Token Counting Verification
- âœ… Handles valid responses correctly
- âœ… Gracefully handles invalid responses
- âœ… Proper error logging and fallback

### 3. Cost Calculation Verification

- Proper thinking model support

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Monitor token usage logs for any anomalies
2. Track cost projections vs actual costs
3. Verify thinking model detection accuracy
4. Review session summaries for completeness

## Conclusion

The token tracking system has been completely overhauled to:
1. **Match official Gemini API pricing** exactly
2. **Support thinking models** with proper pricing
3. **Handle invalid responses** gracefully
4. **Provide accurate cost calculations** for all scenarios
5. **Enable proper debugging** and monitoring

The system is now production-ready with accurate token tracking and cost monitoring capabilities.
